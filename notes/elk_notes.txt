Can I build my messaging app idea on ELK?
  logstash ingests files dumbly appended-to by messagers
  dissect or grok to parse files and create queryable data
  why bother making a database?
    Is Elasticsearch basically the database?
      docs do say "storing it in Elasticsearch"
      Lucene's implementation of inverted index is highly optimized
      elasticsearch has "shards" and indexes
        each shard is a lucene index

logstash
example
log file -> filebeat -> logstash -> elasticsearch ( -> kibana )
                        - filters (grok and geoip)
goes into elasticsearch index or cluster
logstash is ingest tool
  "data collection engine"

seems like es and logstash are meant to exist one-per-computer
what if I'm running multiple elk-based programs on one computer?
  my practice projects and my real project
  filebeat registry -- there is only one
  but there are many es clusters/indexes
  multiple logstash pipelines
  i can also easily delete the registry after each startup
    /var/lib/filebeat/registry

i need an appender to my messages file... what would be sclable?
  multiple files? a directory?
  isn't the point just that es is the persister?
  this file is really more like a buffer... saving it in raw format--important?
  maybe a backup can be copied over somewhere
  
  Appender appends to messages file
    When messages file is 1000 lines long, it is copied to a document store and erased
  Filebeat constantly reads from messages file


elasticsearch
document store
data structures not tables
cluster of nodes
inverted index = fast search
dedicated data structure per field type
BKD tree -> geo
distributed by default
sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service
tail /var/log/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.log
kibana
packetbeat
community beats

curl localhost:9200/_nodes | jq



Questions
is logstash optional? yes
How do I control elasticsearch index creation and naming?
  See: Bootstrapping a cluster
Where is config? /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml
Is starting the elasticsearch systemd service the same as starting the cluster?



elasticsearch
configuration files
  elasticsearch.yml
  jvm.options
  log4j2.properties
  all in /etc/elasticsearch



****New

lake-pipeline.yml
  goes in /etc/logstash/conf.d/ ?
  or specified on cmd line at startup?
  bin/logstash -f lake-pipeline.conf


elasticsearch, logstash, and kibana create their own users and groups
their files belong to root by default
elasticsearch cannot be run as root by default
  but it can be run as a service

How to create new elasticsearch indices?
