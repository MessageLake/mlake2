### Tasks ###

Features:
  Allow time range modification for feeds
  exclude some tags (tag query) Lucene?

To do:
  Use Elasticsearch backend
  Fulltext search option for feed "tag"

This is not a messaging program until it can support multiple users

cli? html? <- html
vanilla? react? <- react
  lots of reusable components
  much more maintainable, vanilla js creates an esoteric labyrinth
db? <- postgres
  just easy
  no, elasticsearch

Done:
  Feeds based on tags √
  create sample data that displays feeds as they would be populated √
  design query api to add tagged messages √
  display sections of feed √
  display messages √
  see all available tags √

####   Design    ###

to avoid ambiguity with root-level field names, prepend all lake fields with "lake_"
  {"lake_author":"dan","lake_tags":["sales"],"lake_text":"We got a new customer."}

###  Discussion  ###

without multiple users, this is Note Lake

(How is it special?)
Create feeds
delete feeds
edit feeds
